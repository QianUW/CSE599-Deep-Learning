Especially the last two sections so you know what to record for turning in.\n","- Much of the required knowledge in this (and past) homeworks about Python, PyTorch, etc. are not explained fully here. Instead, we expect you to use the existing documentation, search engines, Stack Overflow, etc. for implementation details.\n","- That being said, we have listed several functions in parts of the homework where knowing those functions exist would be especially useful. However you will still need to read the docs on how to specifically use the functions.\n","\n","# Part 0: Initial setup\n","You should recognize this code from last
